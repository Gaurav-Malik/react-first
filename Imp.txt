Learning :: React.js
React.js is used for creating reusable UI components it can be treated as view part in MVC framework
1 It uses jsx(javascript syntex extension).babel packages used to convert it into old javascript
2 It can be used for client or server side programming
3 Uses react-dom rather then original dom(improves performance)

Sample Tutorial

Whenever you want to use something, you need to import it first. If you want to make component usable in other parts of the app, 
you need to export it after creation and import it in the file where you want to use it.(Look into sample app)

Why JSX is advantage? https://medium.com/@housecor/react-s-jsx-the-other-side-of-the-coin-2ace7ab62b98#.oywpqqplz

Angular, Ember and Knockout put “JS” in your HTML.
React puts “HTML” in your JS.

Virtual DOM :: 
Ex:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW DOES THE VIRTUAL DOM WORK?

Imagine you had an object that you modeled around a person. It had every relevant property a person could possibly have, and mirrored the persons current state. This is basically what React does with the DOM.

Now think about if you took that object and made some changes. Added a mustache, some sweet biceps and Steve Buscemi eyes. In React-land, when we apply these changes, two things take place. First, React runs a “diffing” algorithm, which identifies what has changed. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff.
